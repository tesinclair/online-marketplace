Online marketplace: 
Build an online marketplace where users can buy and sell products. You can use PHP to create a 
backend that handles user authentication, product listings, and payments, and React to create a frontend that allows 
users to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout.

To build an online marketplace, you will need to create a PHP backend that includes the following features:

    User authentication: 
    Users should be able to create accounts and log in securely. You will need to handle user registration, 
    login, and logout, as well as password reset and email verification.

    Product listings: 
    Sellers should be able to create product listings, including product names, 
    descriptions, images, and prices. Buyers should be able to browse product listings, filter 
    and sort by various criteria, and view detailed product information.

    Shopping cart: 
    Buyers should be able to add products to their shopping cart, view the contents 
    of their cart, and remove items or update quantities as needed.

    Checkout process: 
    Buyers should be able to securely checkout and pay for their purchases. This will involve 
    integrating with a payment gateway such as Stripe or PayPal.

    Order tracking: 
    Sellers and buyers should be able to view the status of their orders, including shipping 
    information and delivery tracking.

On the frontend, you will need to use React to create a user-friendly and engaging interface that allows users to 
browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout. This will involve creating components such as:

    Product listing component: 
    This component will display a list of products, including product images, names, and prices. Users should 
    be able to filter and sort the list by various criteria such as price or category.

    Product detail component: 
    This component will display detailed information about a specific product, including images, descriptions, 
    and reviews. Users should be able to add the product to their cart from this page.

    Shopping cart component: 
    This component will display the contents of the user's shopping cart, including product names, 
    quantities, and prices. Users should be able to update the cart or proceed to checkout.

    Checkout component: 
    This component will guide the user through the checkout process, including entering their shipping and payment information.

    Order tracking component: 
    This component will display the status of the user's orders, including shipping information and delivery tracking.
